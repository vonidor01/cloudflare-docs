Cloudflare Access allows you to secure internal tools and applications by providing an authentication layer between the end user and your origin server. You can use signals from your existing identity providers (IdPs), device posture providers, and [other rules](/cloudflare-one/policies/access/#selectors) to control who can access your application. You can scope your policies to an entire private IP range, or define granular rules for specific websites, subdomains, and paths.

The setup process for a self-hosted application depends on whether the application is publicly accessible on the Internet or restricted to users on a private network.

- [**Public hostname applications**](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/public-hostname-app/) are self-hosted applications that have public DNS records. Anyone on the Internet can access the application by entering the URL in their browser and authenticating through Cloudflare Access. Securing access to a public website requires a Cloudflare DNS [full setup](/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) or [partial CNAME setup](/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).

- [**Private network applications**](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/) are self-hosted applications that do not have public DNS records, meaning they are not reachable from the public Internet. Remote users must install the WARP client on their device and connect to the application using its private IP or private hostname. To add a private network application, refer to [Connect a private network](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/private-net/cloudflared/).
