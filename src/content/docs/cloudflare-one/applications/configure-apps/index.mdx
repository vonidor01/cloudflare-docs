Cloudflare Access allows you to secure your web applications by acting as an identity aggregator, or proxy. Users can only log in to the application if they meet the criteria you want to introduce.

![Cloudflare Access verifies a user's identity before granting access to your application.](~/assets/images/cloudflare-one/applications/diagram-saas.jpg)

You can protect the following types of web applications:

- [**SaaS applications**](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/saas-apps/) consist of applications your team relies on that are not hosted by your organization. Examples include Salesforce and Workday.

- [**Self-hosted applications**](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/self-hosted-apps/) consist of internal applications that you host in your own environment. These can be the data center versions of tools like the Atlassian suite or applications created by your own team.

- [**Cloudflare Dashboard SSO**](/cloudflare-one/applications/configure-apps/dash-sso-apps/) is a special type of SaaS application that manages SSO settings for the Cloudflare dashboard and has limited permissions for administrator edits.
